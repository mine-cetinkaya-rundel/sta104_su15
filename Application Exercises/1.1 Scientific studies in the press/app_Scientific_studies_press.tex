\ttl{Application exercise \appno{}: \\
Scientific studies in the press}

\inst{Submit your responses on \Sakai{}, under the appropriate assignment. Only one submission per team is required. One team will be randomly selected and their responses will be discussed.}

In this activity you will read media coverage of a study published in a peer reviewed journal, and answer a few of question about a study. It is possible that the article doesn't provide the relevant information to answer certain question(s). If so, refer to the original study (linked below). You do not need to read the entire paper, in fact, you are certainly not expected to understand all of it. Simply find the information that will help you answer the questions. \\
