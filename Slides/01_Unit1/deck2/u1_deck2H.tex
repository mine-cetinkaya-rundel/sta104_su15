\subsection{When describing numerical distributions discuss shape, center, spread, and unusual observations}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Describing distributions of numerical variables}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Shape}: skewness, modality

\item \hl{Center}: an estimate of a \hl{typical} observation in the distribution (mean, median, mode, etc.) 
\begin{itemize}
\item Notation: $\mu$: population mean, $\bar{x}$: sample mean
\end{itemize}

\item \hl{Spread}: measure of variability in the distribution (standard deviation, IQR, range, etc.)

\item \hl{Unusual observations}: observations that stand out from the rest of the data that may be suspected outliers

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\clicker{Which of these is most likely to have a roughly symmetric distribution?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item salaries of a random sample of people from North Carolina
\item \solnMult{weights of adult females}

\item last digits of phone numbers
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Mean vs. median}

\clicker{How do the mean and median of the following two datasets compare? \\
$\:$\\
Dataset 1: 30, 50, 70, 90 \\
Dataset 2: 30, 50, 70, 1000
}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\bar{x}_1 = \bar{x}_2$, $median_1 = median_2$
\item \solnMult{$\bar{x}_1 < \bar{x}_2$, $median_1 = median_2$}

\item $\bar{x}_1 > \bar{x}_2$, $median_1 = median_2$
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standard deviation and variance}

\begin{itemize}

\item Most commonly used measure of variability is the \hl{standard deviation}, which roughly measures the average deviation from the mean
\begin{itemize}
\item Notation: $\sigma$: population standard deviation, $s$: sample standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\item Calculating the standard deviation, for a population (rarely, if ever) and for a sample:

\[ \darkgray{$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}$} \qquad s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}} \]

\item Square of the standard deviation is called the \hl{variance}.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{More on SD}

\disc{Why divide by $n - 1$ instead of $n$ when calculating the sample standard deviation?}

\pause

Lose a ``degree of freedom" for using an estimate (the sample mean, $\bar{x}$), in estimating the sample variance/standard deviation.

\pause

$\:$ \\

\disc{Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
\item To weigh larger deviations more heavily.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Range and IQR}

\clicker{True / False: The range is always at least as large as the IQR for a given dataset.}

\item No

\subsection{Robust statistics are not easily affected by outliers and extreme skew}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Robust statistics}

\begin{itemize}

\item Mean and standard deviation are easily affected by extreme observations since the value of each data point contributes to their calculation.

\item Median and IQR are more robust.

\item Therefore we choose median\&IQR (over mean\&SD) when describing skewed distributions.

\label{mi4}

A \hl{box plot} visualizes the median, the quartiles, and suspected outliers. An \hl{outlier} is defined as an observation more than 1.5$\times$IQR away from the quartiles.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Contradiction?}

\begin{itemize}

\item People of one race are more likely to murder others of the same race, murdering a Caucasian is more likely to result in the death penalty, and there are more Caucasian defendants than African American defendants in the sample.

\pause

\item Controlling for the victim's race reveals more insights into the data, and changes the direction of the relationship between race and death penalty.

\pause

\item This phenomenon is called \hl{Simpson's Paradox}: An association, or a comparison, that holds when we compare two groups can disappear or even be reversed when the original groups are broken down into smaller groups according to some other feature (a confounding/lurking variable).

\end{itemize}
