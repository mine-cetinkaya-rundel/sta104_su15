\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dependence, or another possible explanation?}

\begin{itemize}

\item The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn and yawning are dependent

\pause

\item But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simple be \hl{due to chance}

\pause

\item Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results

\pause

\item So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens

\pause

\item Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will \hl{simulate} our results

\subsection{Competing claims}

\frametitle{Two competing claims}

\begin{enumerate}

\item ``There is nothing going on." \\
Seeing someone yawn and yawning are \hl{independent}, observed difference in proportions of yawners in the treatment and control is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ \hl{Null hypothesis}

\pause

\item ``There is something going on." \\
Seeing someone yawn and yawning are \hl{dependent}, observed difference in proportions of yawners in the treatment and control is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ \hl{Alternative hypothesis}

\frametitle{A trial as a hypothesis test}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/trial}

\begin{itemize}

\item $H_0$: Defendant is innocent 

\item $H_A$: Defendant is guilty

\item Present the evidence: collect data.

\item Judge the evidence: ``Could these data plausibly have happened by chance if the null hypothesis were true?"

\item Make a decision: ``How unlikely is unlikely?"

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recap: hypothesis testing framework}

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a \hl{null hypothesis ($H_0$)} (the status quo)

\pause

\item Set an \hl{alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)} (the research question, i.e. what we're testing for)

\pause

\item Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, either via simulation (today) or theoretical methods (later in the course)

\pause

\item Test results suggest the observed data are 
\begin{itemize}
\item reasonably likely to have occurred even if the null is true $\rightarrow$ stick with the null hypothesis (fail to reject $H_0$)
\item unlikely to have occurred even if the null is true $\rightarrow$ reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Never declare the null hypothesis to be true, because we simply do not know whether it's true or not $\rightarrow$ never ``accept the null hypothesis"

... under the assumption of independence, i.e. leaving things up to chance: \\

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item Results from the simulations based on the \hl{null hypothesis} look like the data $\rightarrow$ difference between the proportions of yawners in the treatment and control groups was simply \hl{due to chance} (yawning is not contagious) \\

\pause

\item Results from the simulations based on the chance model do not look like the data $\rightarrow$ difference between the proportions of yawners in the treatment and control groups was not due to chance, but \hl{due to an actual effect of seeding} (yawning is contagious)

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Simulation setup}

\begin{itemize}

\item A regular deck of cards is comprised of 52 cards: 4 aces, 4 of numbers 2-10, 4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings.

\item Take out two aces from the deck of cards and set them aside.

\item The remaining 50 playing cards to represent each participant in the study:
\begin{itemize}
\item 14 face cards (including the 2 aces) represent the people who yawn.
\item 36 non-face cards represent the people who don't yawn.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Running the simulation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process

\item Divide the cards into two decks:
\begin{itemize}
\item deck 1: 16 cards $\rightarrow$ control
\item deck 2: 34 cards $\rightarrow$ treatment
\end{itemize}

\item Count the number of face cards (yawners) in each deck

\item Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners \red{(treatment - control)}, and submit this value using your clicker - \textbf{only one submission per team per simulation}

\item Repeat steps (1) - (4) many times

\begin{itemize}

\item In a double-blind experiment a sample of male college students were asked to tap their fingers at a rapid rate. 

\item The sample was then divided at random into two groups of 10 students each. 

\item Each student drank the equivalent of about two cups of coffee, which included about 200 mg of caffeine for the students in one group but was decaffeinated coffee for the second group. 

\item After a two hour period, each student was tested to measure finger tapping rate (taps per minute).
