\begin{itemize}
\item 1.6 (c): How is income recorded? (Under 2,600; 10,400 to 15,600; above 36,400; ...)
\item 1.14 (b): What type of a sample is it if you only ask your friends to respond?
\item 1.46 (c): Is the histogram or the intensity map more informative?

\item \hl{Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events} cannot happen at the same time
\begin{itemize}
\item A voter cannot register as a Democrat and a Republican at the same time
\item But s/he might be a Republican and a Moderate at the same time -- \hl{non-disjoint events}
\item For disjoint A and B: $P(A~and~B) = 0$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item If A and B are \hl{independent events}, having information on A does not tell us anything about B (and vice versa)
\begin{itemize}
\item If A and B are independent: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(A~|~B) = P(A)$
\item $P(A~and~B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
