\begin{quote} 
[These data are] from an experiment run by a British video-game manufacturer in an attempt to calibrate the level of difficulty of certain tasks in the video game. Subjects in this experiment were presented with a simple ``Where's Waldo?"-style visual scene. The subjects had to find a number (1 or 2) floating somewhere in the scene, to identify the number, and to press the corresponding button as quickly as possible. The response variable is their reaction time.

\section{Main ideas}

\subsection{To identify which means are different, use pairwise t-tests}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multiple testing}

\clicker{Suppose we want to determine which subjects have a mean reaction time different than Subject 6. How many pairwise t-tests will we need to do? Remember: there were a total of 12.}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 6
\item \solnMult{11}
\item 12
\item $\frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15$
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multiple testing}

\clicker{Suppose we want to determine which means are different from each other. How many pairwise t-tests would we need to conduct? Remember: there were a total of 12 groups.}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 12
\item 12! = 479,001,600
\item $12 \times 11 = 132$
\item \solnMult{$\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66$}
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\subsection{If you want to test many hypotheses simultaneously, use the Bonferroni correction}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2. If you want to test many hypotheses simultaneously, use the Bonferroni correction}

\vfill

Bonferroni correction: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Target type I error rate: $\alpha$.

\item Number of null/alt hypotheses to be tested using the same data set: $K$

\item If you set the significance level for each test to be
\[
\alpha^* = \alpha / K,
\]
then the probability of making one or more type I errors is $ \leq \alpha$.

\end{itemize}
